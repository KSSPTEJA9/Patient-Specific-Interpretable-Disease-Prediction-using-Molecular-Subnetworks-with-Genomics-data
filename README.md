Project Short Description - Enhancing Interpretability in Graph-CNNs for Breast Cancer Predictions

Overview
Contemporary deep learning models are achieving remarkable success in complex predictive tasks, yet their use in healthcare has been limited due to their perceived lack of interpretability. Despite being seen as opaque 'black boxes,' recent advancements in interpretability techniques have begun to shed light on the decision-making processes of these models. These developments are particularly promising for personalized medicine, as they offer explanations for individual patient predictions.

Project Description
This project introduces an adaptation of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph-CNNs), termed Graph Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GLRP). GLRP aims to enhance the interpretability of Graph-CNNs, which are used to analyze molecular networks and gene expression data.

Key Features
GLRP Technique: Adaptation of LRP specifically for Graph-CNNs.
Molecular Network Analysis: Utilizes structural information from molecular networks to make predictions.
Breast Cancer Dataset: Validated on a substantial dataset, focusing on forecasting metastatic events in breast cancer patients.
Interpretability in Genomics: Clarifies which aspects of a molecular network contribute to predictions, aiding in personalized medicine.
Significance
GLRP has the potential to greatly enhance the interpretation of classification tasks in genomics, using both genomics data and existing molecular network knowledge. This could be incredibly beneficial for personalized medicine strategies and molecular tumor boards, where individual patient-level analysis is crucial.

Usage
Researchers and practitioners can use GLRP to gain insights into the decision-making processes of Graph-CNNs, improving the transparency and trustworthiness of these models in critical healthcare applications.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of GLRP in making Graph-CNNs more interpretable, thereby fostering their adoption in personalized medicine and improving patient-specific analysis in breast cancer predictions.
